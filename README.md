PHOENIX UAV is an autonomous fixed-wing aircraft designed and built for early wildfire detection and monitoring. The V-tail airframe, constructed from Depron and depron with carbon fiber reinforcement, housing a Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller, Topdon TC001 thermal camera, and Raspberry Pi 4B running a custom AI detection system. The neural network, optimized for edge deployment, processes thermal imagery in real-time with 93.4% detection accuracy and has been compressed from 12.7MB to 1.1MB for efficient operation. When a fire is detected, the UAV automatically transitions to loiter mode, circling the location while transmitting georeferenced thermal images to ground control every 5 seconds. With ~70 minutes of flight endurance, and a total system cost of approximately $800, PHOENIX represents a practical, accessible solution for resource-constrained firefighting agencies, enabling earlier intervention and reducing wildfire damage to ecosystems and communities.
